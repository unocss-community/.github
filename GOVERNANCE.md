# UnoCSS Community Organization Governance

UnoCSS Community organization is a community-driven collection of presets and transformers. Each repository is autonomous, maintained and distributed by it's own maintainers. The team has a loose structure, that each repository many have it's own decision making process, and the team is there to help and support.

In case a repository's maintainers are temporarily unavailable, the team may help to maintain the repository or doing necessary hot releases under the agreement of the team members.

## Organization Owners

Current organization owners are:

- Chris [@zyyv](https://github.com/zyyv)

Organization owners are mainly for managing the organization permissions and repositories. And will not directly involve in the decision making process of each repository.

## Team Members

Team members are the authors or maintainers of one or more repositories in the organization. 

New team members will be invited by the organization owners when they [contribute a new repository](./PACKAGE_CONTRIBUTE.md) to the organization.

## Contributors

For each repository, the maintainer(s) can invite active contributors to the specific repository as a outside collaborator to give them necessary permissions and well as creditability to that repository.
